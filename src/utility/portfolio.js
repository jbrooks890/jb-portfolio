          Hi, I’m Julian! I’m a [occupation] based out of Smyrna, GA. I’m
          originally from Chicago, and I lived in Florida, near Destin while
          served in the Air Force. Though I can’t confirm it, I may actually be
          equal parts technical and creative with the tie-breaker being my mood.
          I have a deep appreciation for creative expression, elegant design,
          and intuitive and thoughtful execution. I consider myself a lifelong
          student, always intrigued by the old, the new and the unknown.

          In 2016 I built the website for EPOCH&nbsp;Studios with Squarespace,
          marking the start of my web development journey. My skill grew the
          more I exploited the platform’s Custom CSS and other coding outlet
          features until I felt I had exhausted its limited functionality. In
          May of 2022 I enrolled in a Software Engineering bootcamp where I
          learned React and MongoDB among other languages and tools.

          Art has been a passion of mine since childhood. My inspiration came
          from many sources, but primarily cartoons, games and movies. I have
          worked as a freelance artist with clients including music artists,
          school alumni boards and the U.S. Air Force.

          I have always written as much as I've drawn, words being another
          deeply-rooted form of expression for me. I enjoy the “what-ifs” of
          life and explore those notions in my writing. In 2016, I
          self-published my Fantasy/Sci-Fi novel,{" "}
          <i>Arcan: The Missing Nexus</i> under my own imprint EPOCH Studios. I
          have since penned smaller projects that allow me to explore my other
          ideas.

          I began developing my first video game in high school using RPG Maker.
          I have since began my own game development journey, aspiring to tell
          my own captivating stories and pay homage to the games that inspired
          me.
