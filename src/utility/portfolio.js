          In 2016, I began using <strong>Squarespace</strong> to build the
          website for EPOCH&nbsp;Studios, marking the start of my web
          development journey. My skill with HTML, CSS and Javascript grew the
          more I endeavored to add features to my website that were not yet
          availabe on the platform. Once I felt I had exhausted the limited
          functionality of its coding outlet, I began exploring other options.
          In May of 2022 I enrolled in a{" "}
          <strong>Software Engineering bootcamp</strong> where I learned{" "}
          <i>React</i> and <i>MongoDB</i>, among other languages and tools,
          enabling me to build better applications with a more robust toolset.

          Art has been a passion of mine since childhood. My inspiration came
          from many sources, but primarily cartoons, games and movies. I have
          worked as a freelance artist with clients including music artists,
          school alumni boards and the U.S. Air Force.

          I have always written as much as I've drawn, words being another
          deeply-rooted form of expression for me. I enjoy the “what-ifs” of
          life and explore those notions in my writing. In 2016, I
          self-published my Fantasy/Sci-Fi novel,{" "}
          <i>Arcan: The Missing Nexus</i> under my own imprint EPOCH Studios. I
          have since penned smaller projects that allow me to explore my other
          ideas.

          I was first introduced to game development in high school with{" "}
          <strong>RPG Maker XP</strong>. Though the coding element of it
          ultimately overwhelmed me, I had seen the beauty of game design's
          multi-faceted enterprise. I could write, draw <i>and</i> code! Since
          then, I've aspired to create my own games that tell captivating
          stories while also paying homage to the games that inspired me.
