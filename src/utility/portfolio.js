          Hi, I’m Julian! I’m a [occupation] based out of Smyrna, GA. I’m
          originally from Chicago, and I lived in Florida, near Destin while
          served in the Air Force. Though I can’t confirm it, I may actually be
          equal parts technical and creative with the tie-breaker being my mood.
          I have a deep appreciation for creative expression, elegant design,
          and intuitive and thoughtful execution. I consider myself a lifelong
          student, always intrigued by the old, the new and the unknown.

          I began my web development journey in 2016 when I built the website
          for EPOCH Studios with the Squarespace website builder. My skill grew
          the more I exploited the platform’s Custom CSS and other coding outlet
          features until I eventually felt I had outgrown its limited
          functionality. In May of 2022 I enrolled in a Software Engineering
          bootcamp where I learned React and MongoDB among other languages and
          tools.

          Art has been a passion of mine since childhood. My inspiration came
          from many sources, but primarily cartoons, games and movies. I have
          worked as a freelance artist with clients including music artists,
          school alumni boards and the U.S. Air Force.

      blurb: (
        <>
          My visual and verbal artistry go hand-in-hand. I have always written
          as much as I drew, words being another deeply-rooted form of
          expression for me. I enjoy the “what-ifs” of life and explore those
          notions in my writing. In 2016, I self-published my Fantasy/Sci-Fi
          novel, Arcan: The Missing Nexusunder my own imprint EPOCH Studios.
          Arcan remains my greatest project and is going, but I have since began
          lesser projects that allow me to explore my other ideas.

      blurb: (
        <>
          Video games just hit differently in the 90’s, but a certain genre of
          game strummed a more insidious chord than the others: role-playing
          games. Story mode had greater priority in games then than they do now,
          but RPG’s made it the forefront and the storytelling is what inspired
          me most about anything, any form of media. Games were (and still are)
          the ultimate combination of visual, verbal and musical artistry—aside
          from film. Games engage the player more so. I have since began my own
          game development journey, aspiring to tell my own captivating stories
          and pay homage to the games that inspired me.{" "}
